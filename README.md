### Hi! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Ray.
- PhD Student @ MIT Mechanical Engineering. ðŸŽ“

My primary interests are generative design, additive manufacturing, computer graphics, finite elements, weird emergence, visual art, lemurs.
Most of my code-related projects are kept here; they cover a wide range, from hardware-embedded IoT finagling, to web development, to math problems, to desktop applications & hackathon entries written in whatever language has caught my attention recently.
